# Customer Churn Prediction App

This is a Streamlit web application for predicting customer churn using a deep learning model trained on the `Churn_Modelling.csv` dataset.

## üß† Model Overview

- **Model Type**: Neural Network (TensorFlow / Keras)
- **Input Features**:
  - Geography (One-Hot Encoded)
  - Gender (Label Encoded)
  - Credit Score
  - Age
  - Tenure
  - Balance
  - Number of Products
  - Has Credit Card
  - Is Active Member
  - Estimated Salary
- **Output**: Probability of churn (binary classification)

## üîç Key Features

- Built using **Streamlit** for a lightweight, interactive UI.
- Trained and deployed using **TensorFlow** for churn prediction.
- Real-time user input transformed using:
  - `LabelEncoder` for Gender
  - `OneHotEncoder` for Geography
  - `StandardScaler` for feature scaling
- Encoders and scalers are pre-trained and loaded with the app.

## üîß Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
